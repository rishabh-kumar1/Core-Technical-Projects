# Projects 

Spanning across 4 years of EECS, here are some highlights! Primarly written in C++/C, JS(React), Python, Flask, SQL, Docker, Kubernetes, etc these projects span core Data Structures and Algorithms concepts, Computer Architecture (Assembly, Data pipelining, etc), and Web Systems (Search Engine Clone, Instagram Clone, MapReduce). There also a couple of coding challenges that I have completed over the last year :)
